# Exoplanet Generator

This project generates a random but scientifically plausible exoplanet with various metadata, 
validates its atmospheric and planetary properties, and outputs the results in JSON format.

## Usage
Run the script:
```bash
python main.py
```

The output is displayed in the terminal and saved in the `output/` directory.
